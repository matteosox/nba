## Info

### NBA Stats and Analysis

- Author: Matt Fay
- Email: matt.e.fay@gmail.com
- [Repo](https://github.com/matteosox/nba)

### Description

This repo has three main parts:
1) `pynba`: a Python package of stuff to analyze nba data.
2) `notebooks`: a collection of Jupyter notebooks analyzing nba data using `pynba`.
3) `app`: a Next.js web app hosted at [nba.mattefay.com], displaying the latest stats.

## User Notes

TBD

## Developer Notes

### Getting started

We use Docker for a clean environment within which to build/test/release. The `build.sh` script in the `cicd` directory will build the relevant images for you. Running the CI/CD workflow natively isn't a supported/maintained thing.

### Documenting changes

_TL;DR: Run `changelog (added|changed|deprecated|removed|fixed|security) "<message>"` before committing your changes to document them._

We use [`changelog-cli`](https://github.com/mc706/changelog-cli) to document changes from version to version in the `CHANGELOG.md` file. Before committing changes that impact users of the `pynba` package, use the command-line tool to document features added, changed, deprecated, removed, fixed, or security-related changes. **TBD on what dev environment to do this in!**

### Versioning

_TL;DR: Run `./docs/release.sh` to summarize unreleased changes in `CHANGELOG.md` and update the package's version._

We version this package, using the syntax defined in [PEP440](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/). For best practices, you can read about it [here](https://the-hitchhikers-guide-to-packaging.readthedocs.io/en/latest/specification.html#sequence-based-scheme).

To simplify this, we use [`changelog-cli`](https://github.com/mc706/changelog-cli) to generate versions for us. This can be done ... **FIGURE THIS OUT**.

### Code Style

Planning to implement a Black pre-commit hook, but **haven't done that yet.**

### Updating the dev & notebook python requirements

_TL;DR: Run `./requirements/update_requirements_in_docker.sh` after building the build environment, i.e. `./cicd/build.sh`._

There are four requirements files checked into this directory:
1) `dev_requirements.in`
2) `dev_requirements.txt`
1) `notebook_requirements.in`
2) `notebook_requirements.txt`

The `.in` files are where we collect immediate dependencies, described in PyPI format (with versions pinned only as needed). The `.txt` files are generated by running the `./requirements/update_requirements_in_docker.sh` script. This script runs the `./requirements/update_requirements.sh` inside the `dev` Docker container. We do this because `pip-compile` should be run from the same virtual environment as your project so conditional dependencies that require a specific Python version, or other environment markers, resolve relative to your projectâ€™s environment.

This gives us both a flexible way to describe dependencies while still achieving reproducible builds. Inspired by [this](https://hynek.me/articles/python-app-deps-2018/) and [this](https://pythonspeed.com/articles/pipenv-docker/).

### Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment TBD

Planning to use Github actions for this, but nothing is setup yet.

### Buildin Stuff

_TL;DR: To run tests, run `./cicd/build.sh`._

This builds the three relevant docker images, `dev`, `notebook`, and `app`.

### Runnin Tests

_TL;DR: To run tests, run `./cicd/test.sh`._

We use the built-in Python module `unittest`'s [test discovery](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#test-discovery) functionality. This requires that all of the test files must be modules or packages importable from the root of the repo. As well, they must match the pattern `test*.py`. Our practice is to put tests for a module in a test folder in the same directory, which can then also contain data and other files needed to run those tests.

The package is installed using `setuptools`'s [`find_packages` function](https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html#using-find-packages). We use the `exclude` feature to exclude all test code, i.e. `exclude=["*.tests", "*.tests.*", "tests.*", "tests"]`.

Thus, to run tests, we mount the root of the repo to the location in the container it's been installed. All of this is handled nicely by running `test.sh`, which uses the `dev` container.

**Web app tests to be determined.**

### Depolyin

Planning to use Vercel for free hosting, but nothing is setup yet.

### Pull Requests

The `main` branch has [branch protections](https://help.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/about-protected-branches) turned on in Github, requiring one reviewer to approve a PR before merging. We also use the code owners feature to specify who can approve certain PRs. As well, merging a PR requires status checks to complete successfully, but those **haven't been defined yet.**

When naming a branch, please use the syntax `firstname/branch-name-here`. If you plan to collaborate with others on that branch, use `team/branch-name-here`.
