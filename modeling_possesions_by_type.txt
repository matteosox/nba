Turnover / poss

How to handle free throws...

Off live ball turnover = k * TO%
Off def rebound = 0.4 * fta/poss * (1 - ft%) + (1 - k * to% - 0.4 * fta/poss) * make%
Off made shot (or non live ball turnover) = 1 - other two

multiply by league average for live ball to/def reb/made shot

M_ij = given i possession origin, results in j next possession

p1 = M1 p0
p0 = M0 p1

p0 is an eigenvector of M1 * M0
p1 is an eigenvector of M0 * M1
Only solve for one, then multiply by M for the other

M1 * M0 * p0 = p0
M0 * M1 * p1 = p1
